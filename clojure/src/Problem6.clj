; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
; 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 385

; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
; (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 = 3025

; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
; square of the sum is 3025 ? 385 = 2640.

; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and
; the square of the sum.
